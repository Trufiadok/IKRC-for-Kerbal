# IKRC-for-Kerbal
Inverse Kinematics Robot Controller for Kerbal

The IKRC uses the InfernalRobotics API. I needed to modify a bit for the correct operation (InfernalRoboticsMod).
Ca2LeeCam is a camera plugin for Latch End Effector.
The Canadarm2 directory contains the Kerbal Parts and the built-in robot arm.
The IkRobotController directory contains the source of the plugin in C#.
