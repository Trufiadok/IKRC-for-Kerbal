	description = A fixture to place on objects you wish to grab with the RKE-LEE. **HOW IT WORKS** This is a docking port, and can only dock with the RKE-LEE effector. Maneuver a LEE correctly over a PDGF and they will dock together. Attach a PDGF (or more!) on your satellites, space stations, etc. and you can grab them with the LEE.
